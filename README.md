# Rainbow Loader

This project is a visually striking rainbow loader animation that features rotating rainbow-colored arcs, designed purely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). The goal of the loader is to provide a vibrant and engaging visual that can be used while a page or data is being loaded.

## Features
- **Rainbow Animation**: Six concentric rainbow arcs animate in a rotation to create a visually engaging loading effect.
- **Pure CSS Animations**: The rainbow arcs are animated using CSS keyframes, resulting in a smooth and captivating effect.
- **Flexible Layout**: The loader adjusts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent and aesthetically pleasing appearance across devices.

## Files
- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure for the loader, including the main elements for the rainbow arcs.
- **style.css**: Manages the styling and animations for the rainbow loader, using CSS keyframes to control the arcs and ensure the smooth spinning effect.
- **index.js**: Handles any additional interactive behaviors (not extensively used for this project).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Provides the structure for the rainbow arcs and surrounding container.
- **CSS3**: Responsible for styling the arcs and animating them using keyframes to achieve the rainbow spinning effect.
- **JavaScript (with jQuery)**: Used minimally for handling any dynamic behaviors, though most of the project is accomplished using HTML and CSS.
